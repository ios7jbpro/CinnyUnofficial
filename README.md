# CinnyUnofficial
 An unofficial mobile Cinny Matrix client.
This solely exists because the Cinny app under Chrome(or any browser to be real) sucks to use, for such reasons, like swipe to refresh the page. All this app does is load the website in with all required things(JavaScript, cookies, etc.) in default Android WebView for a better experience.


SWB file for Sketchware Pro users is also provided.

You need Android 12 SDK to be able to compile this project.
